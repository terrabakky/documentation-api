# Cloud Conformity Events API

Below is a list of the available APIs:

- [List All Events](#list-all-events)


## List All Events

This endpoint allows you to collect events that you have access to.

##### Endpoints:

`GET /events`

##### Parameters
- `accountIds`: A comma-separated list of Cloud Conformity accountIds. 
- `aws`: true | false; defaults to true for returning AWS events.
- `cc`: true | false; defaults to true for returning Cloud Conformity activity-events.
- `page[size]`: Indicates the number of results that should be returned. Maximum value is 1000 and defaults to 100 if not specified
- `page[number]`: Indicates the page number, defaults to 0
- `filter`: Optional parameter including services, regions, userIds, identities, since, and until.

**IMPORTANT:**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some guidelines about using this endpoint:
1. If acountIds are not provided, events are returned from all accounts you have access to. If you are ADMIN, organisation-level events are also returned.
2. If you provide an accountId to an account you do not have at least ReadOnly access to, events from that account will not be returned.
3. You can pull 2 types of events from this endpoint. `aws=true` will return **AWS events**; `cc=true` will return Cloud Conformity **activity-events**. For more information, see example below.
4. All events have a name attribute. Some important Cloud Conformity events are listed in the [Event Names Table](#event-names). <br />
Using the filter[name] as part of your query will get a history of that specific event. filter[name] also supports wildcards.
    1. Astericks at the end: `filter[name]=account.bot.update*` will get all events where the name starts with account.bot.update.
    2. Astericks in the middle:`filter[name]=account.*.update*` will match all account updating events like `account.bot.update` and `account.rule.update`.
    3. Use of question marks: `filter[name]=a??.check.create` will match `api.check.created` and not `account.check.created`. Each ? is a character wildcard. 
<br />

##### Filtering
The `filter` query parameter is reserved to be used as the basis for filtering. Any plural filter parameters (e.g. filter[region **s**]) accepts a comma-seperated list. E.g. `filter[regions]=us-east-1,us-east-2`

The table below give more information about filter options:

| Name  | Values |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| filter[regions]  | global \| us-east-2 \| us-east-1 \| us-west-1 \| us-west-2 \| ap-south-1 \| ap-northeast-2 \|<br />ap-southeast-1 \| ap-southeast-2 \| ap-northeast-1 \| ca-central-1 \| eu-central-1 \| eu-west-1 \|<br /> eu-west-2 \| sa-east-1 <br /><br />For more information about regions, please refer to [Cloud Conformity Region Endpoint](https://us-west-2.cloudconformity.com/v1/regions) |
| filter[services]  | AutoScaling \| CloudConformity \|CloudFormation \| CloudFront \| CloudTrail \| CloudWatch \|<br />CloudWatchEvents \| CloudWatchLogs \| Config \| DynamoDB \| EBS \| EC2 \| ElastiCache \| Elasticsearch \| ELB \| IAM \| KMS \| RDS \| Redshift \| ResourceGroup \| Route53 \| S3 \| SES \|<br />SNS \| SQS \| VPC \| WAF \| ACM \| Inspector \| TrustedAdvisor \| Shield \| EMR \| Lambda \|<br />Support \| Organizations \| Kinesis \| EFS<br /><br />For more information about services, please refer to [Cloud Conformity Services Endpoint](https://us-west-2.cloudconformity.com/v1/services)<br /><br /> Additionally, events we recieve from AWS may have different service labels such as "ec2.amazonaws.com" |
| filter[userIds]  | A comma-separated list of Cloud Conformity userIds. Only activity-events will have userIds. |
| filter[name]  | String, name of event. Supports wild cards (see point 4 above ) |
| filter[identities]| Only incoming AWS events will have identities. |
| filter[since]  | Refers to the start of the time range you want to query for events.<br /><br />The numeric value of the specified time as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC |
| filter[until]  |  Refers to the end of the time range you want to query for events.<br /><br />The numeric value of the specified date as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC |
<br />


For example, the following is a request for static-deployer events within a specified time frame on one account:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
     -H "Authorization: ApiKey S1YnrbQuWagQS0MvbSchNHDO73XHqdAqH52RxEPGAggOYiXTxrwPfmiTNqQkTq3p" \
     https://us-west-2-api.cloudconformity.com/v1/events?accountIds=ryi9NPivK&filter[identities]=static-deployer&filter[since]=1519919272016&filter[until]=1519932055819
```
